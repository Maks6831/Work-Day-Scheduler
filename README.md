# Work-Day-Scheduler

Project to create a daily schedule using JQuery

### Project Description 

The purpose of this project was to create a Day Schedule app which saves the input of the end user so that they can use it throughout the day to track their work. The Schedule saves the user's input in local storage so that upon revisiting the page, the task are printed to the section corresponding to the local time. The Schedule also implements Moment.js to dynamically change the colours of the input divs: red is for the present, grey depicts the tasks before the current time and green depict the tasks after the current time (the tasks that still need to be done). The main section containing all of the inputs are all dynamically created using JQuery.
